			About Us
		</h3>
		<p class="text-pretty text-lg">
			Hi there! I'm Brandon Jordan, the owner of Southern Comfort Total
			Home Care, proudly serving families across West Georgia. I started
			this business in 2023 with one simple goal — to provide honest,
			high-quality home repair and improvement services while supporting
			my own family — my wife and our son. At Southern Comfort, we handle
			just about everything your home needs — from repairs, carpentry, and
			painting to plumbing, electrical work, and remodeling projects. No
			job is too small, and every job gets the same care and attention to
			detail. What makes us different is the personal touch we bring to
			every project. We treat your home like it's our own and believe that
			good business is built on relationships, not transactions. That
			means fair pricing, reliable service, and a satisfaction guarantee
			you can count on. When you call Southern Comfort, you're not dealing
			with a big company — you're working with a neighbor who genuinely
			cares about your home and your comfort.
